# Diced Skull

This is the official repository of [Diced Skull](https://kraby.itch.io/diced-skull), which was submitted for the [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022/rate/1625000), themed "Roll the dice".

This is not the code for the game jam release, a few bugfixes were made some hours after the game jam deadlines, and this repository is the fixed version.

## Objective

Reach the stairs and go to the next floor. You have to make your own dice composition, mixing abilities and penalties. The bigger penalties you have, the stronger your abilities become.
Be too greedy and you'll have to survive under a bullet-hell you created for yourself.

## Builds

- [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZxbTy9L_uW31NtP1DCGjpkQLyMqXudJ0/view?usp=sharing)

## Controls

Gamepad support only for now
- Left stick : move
- Right stick: aim
- Right analog: roll the dice
- D-pad : navigate menus
- Circle: confirm menus
- Cross: cancel menus


## Known bugs

- It's possible to compose a dice without any ability (softlock in floor 1 and 3)

Do not hesitate to open an issue if you think you found a glitch.
